PADS Quickstart Guide
=====================

Requesting Access
-----------------
If you do not already have a Computation Institute account, you can request
one at https://www.ci.uchicago.edu/accounts/. This page will give you a list
of resources you can request access to. 
You already have an existing CI account, but do not have access to Beagle,
send an email to support@ci.uchicago.edu to request access.

Connecting to a login node
--------------------------
Once you have account, you should be able to access a Beagle login
node with the following command:

-----
ssh yourusername@login.beagle.ci.uchicago.edu
-----

Follow the steps outlined below to get started with Swift on Beagle:

*step 1.* Load the Swift module on Beagle as follows: +module load swift+

*step 2.* Create and change to a directory where your Swift related work will
stay. (say, +mkdir swift-lab+, followed by, +cd swift-lab+)

*step 3.* To get started with a simple example running +/bin/cat+ to read an
input file +data.txt+ and write to an output file +f.nnn.out+, copy the folder
at +/home/ketan/catsn+ to the above directory. (+cp -r /home/ketan/catsn
.+ followed by +cd catsn+).

*step 4.*  In the sites file: +beagle-coaster.xml+, make the following two
changes: *1)* change the path of +workdirectory+ to your preferred location
(say to +/lustre/beagle/$USER/swift-lab/swift.workdir+) and *2)* Change the
project name to your project (+CI-CCR000013+) . The workdirectory will contain
execution data related to each run, e.g. wrapper scripts, system information,
inputs and outputs.

*step 5.* Run the example using following commandline (also found in run.sh):
+swift -config cf -tc.file tc -sites.file beagle-coaster.xml catsn.swift -n=1+
. You can further change the value of +-n+ to any arbitrary number to run that
many number of concurrent +cat+

*step 6.* Check the output in the generated +outdir+ directory (+ls outdir+)

Note: Running from sandbox node or requesting 1 hour walltime for upto 3 nodes
will get fast prioritized execution. Good for small tests.
