Language features
-----------------

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

Procedures can have parameters. Input parameters specify inputs to the
procedure and output parameters specify outputs. Our helloworld greeting
procedure already uses an output parameter, t, which indicates where the
greeting output will go. In this section, we will add an input parameter
to the greeting function.

The code changes from first.swift are highlighted below.
ToDo: Highlight the differences!
 
----
include::../../examples/parameter.swift[]
----

We have modified the signature of the greeting procedure to indicate
that it takes a single parameter, s, of type 'string'.

We have modified the invocation of the 'echo' utility so that it takes
the value of s as a parameter, instead of the string literal "Hello,
world!".

We have modified the output file definition to point to a different file
on disk.

We have modified the invocation of greeting so that a greeting string is
supplied.

The code for this section can be found in parameter.swift. It can be
invoked using the swift command, with output appearing in hello2.txt:

 
----
$ swift parameter.swift
----

Now that we can choose our greeting text, we can call the same procedure
with different parameters to generate several output files with
different greetings. The code is in manyparam.swift and can be run as
before using the swift command.

 
----
include::../../examples/manyparam.swift[]
----

Note that we can intermingle definitions of variables with invocations
of procedures.

When this program has been run, there should be three new files in the
working directory (english.txt, francais.txt and nihongo.txt) each
containing a greeting in a different language.

In addition to specifying parameters positionally, parameters can be
named, and if desired a default value can be specified - see <<named_parameters, Named and Optional Parameters>>.
ToDo: link not working.

Adding another application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now we'll define a new application procedure. The procedure we define
will capitalise all the words in the input file.

To do this, we'll use the unix tr (translate) utility. Here is an
example of using tr on the unix command line, not using Swift:

 
----
$ echo hello | tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'
HELLO
----

.There are several steps
- Updating the transformation catalog
- Updating the application block

ToDo: What is transformation catalog? One line explanation.

First we need to modify the transformation catalog to define a logical
transformation for the tr utility. A transformation catalog lists where executables are located on computational sites. 
The transformation catalog can be found in etc/tc.data. There are already several entries specifying
where executables can be found. Add a new line to the file, specifying
where *tr* can be found (usually in /usr/bin/tr but it may differ on
your system), like this:

 
----
localhost       tr      /usr/bin/tr     INSTALLED       INTEL32::LINUX  null  
----

For now, ignore all of the fields except the second and the third. The
second field tr specifies a logical application name and the third
specifies the location of the application executable.

Now that we have defined where to find tr, we can use it in SwiftScript.

We can define a new procedure, capitalise, which calls tr.

 
----
(messagefile o) capitalise(messagefile i) {     
    app {  
        tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]" stdin=@filename(i) stdout=@filename(o);  
    }  
}  
----
We can call capitalise like this:

 
----
messagefile final <"capitals.txt">;  
final = capitalise(hellofile);  
----

So a full program based on the first exercise might look like this:

 
----
include::../../examples/second_procedure.swift[]
----

We can use the swift command to run it like this.

 
----
$ swift second_procedure.swift
...
$ cat capitals.txt
HELLO FROM SWIFT
----

Anonymous files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the previous section, the file greeting.txt is used only to store
an intermediate result. We don't really care about which name is used
for the file, and we can let Swift choose the name.

To do that, omit the mapping entirely when declaring outfile:

 
----
messagefile outfile;  
----

Swift will choose a filename, which in the present version will be in a
subdirectory called _concurrent.


Datatypes
~~~~~~~~~
All data in variables and files has a data type. So far, we've seen two
types:

    - string - this is a built-in type for storing strings of text in
      memory, much like in other programming languages
    - messagefile - this is a user-defined type used to mark disc resident files as
      containing messages

SwiftScript has the additional built-in types: boolean, integer and
float that function much like their counterparts in other programming
languages.

It is also possible to create user defined types with more structure,
for example:

 
----
type details {  
    string name;  
    int pies;  
}  
----

Each element of the structured type can be accessed using a . like this:

 
----
person.name = "john";  
----

The following complete program, types.swift, outputs a greeting using a
user-defined structure type to hold parameters for the message:

 
----
include::../../examples/types.swift[]
----

Structured types can be comprised of marker types for files. See the
later section on mappers for more information about this.


Arrays
~~~~~~

We can define arrays using the [] suffix in a variable declaration:

 
----
messagefile m[];  
----

This program, q5.swift, will declare an array of message files.

 
----
include::../../examples/q5.swift[]
----

Observe that the type of the parameter to greeting is now an array of
strings, string s[], instead of a single string, string s, that
elements of the array can be referenced numerically, for example s[0],
and that the array is initialised using an array literal,
["how","are","you"].


Mappers
~~~~~~~

A significant difference between SwiftScript and other languages is that
data can be referred to on disk through variables in a very similar
fashion to data in memory. For example, in the above examples we have
seen a variable definition like this:

 
----
messagefile outfile <"q13greeting.txt">;  
----

This means that outfile is a dataset variable, which is mapped to a
file on disk called g13greeting.txt. This variable can be assigned to
using = in a similar fashion to an in-memory variable. We can say that
outfile is mapped onto the disk file q13greeting.txt by a mapper.

There are various ways of mapping in SwiftScript. Two forms have already
been seen in this tutorial. Later exercises will introduce more forms.

The two forms of mapping seen so far are:

simple named mapping - the name of the file that a variable is mapped to
is explictly listed. Like this:

 
----
messagefile outfile <"greeting.txt">;  
----

This is useful when you want to explicitly name input and output files
for your program. For example, outfile in exercise HELLOWORLD.

anonymous mapping - no name is specified in the source code. A name is
automatically generated for the file. This is useful for intermediate
files that are only referenced through SwiftScript, such as outfile in
exercise ANONYMOUSFILE. A variable declaration is mapped anonymously by
ommitting any mapper definition, like this:

 
----
messagefile outfile;  
----

Later exercises will introduce other ways of mapping from disk files to
SwiftScript variables.

TODO: introduce @v syntax.


The Regexp Mapper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this exercise, we introduce the regexp mapper. This mapper
transforms a string expression using a regular expression, and uses the
result of that transformation as the filename to map.

regexp.swift demonstrates the use of this by placing output into a
file that is based on the name of the input file: our input file is
mapped to the inputfile variable using the simple named mapper, and then
we use the regular expression mapper to map the output file. Then we use
the countwords() procedure to count the works in the input file and
store the result in the output file. In order for the countwords()
procedure to work correctly, add the wc utility (usually found in
/usr/bin/wc) to tc.data.

The important bit of regexp.swift is:

 
----
messagefile inputfile <"q16.txt">;  
  
countfile c <regexp_mapper;  
             source=@inputfile,  
             match="(.*)txt",  
             transform="\\1count"  
            >;  
----

fixed_array_mapper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The fixed array mapper maps a list of files into an array - each
element of the array is mapped into one file in the specified directory.
See fixedarray.swift.

 
----
include::../../examples/fixedarray.swift[]
----

foreach
~~~~~~~
SwiftScript provides a control structure, foreach, to  operate on each
element of an array in parallel.

In this example, we will run the previous word counting example over
each file in an array without having to explicitly list the array
elements. The source code for this example is in foreach.swift. The
three input files: one.txt, two.txt and three.txt are supplied.
After you have run the workflow, you should see that there are three
output files: one.count, two.count and three.count, each
containing the word count for the corresponding input file. We combine
the use of the fixed_array_mapper and the regexp_mapper.

 
----
include::../../examples/foreach.swift[]
----

If
~~
Decisions can be made using 'if', like this:

----
if(morning) {  
  outfile = greeting("good morning");  
} else {  
  outfile = greeting("good afternoon");  
}  
----

if.swift contains a simple example of this. Compile and run if.swift
and see that it outputs "good morning". Changing the morning variable
from true to false will cause the program to output "good afternoon".

Sequential iteration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A serial execution of instructions can be carried out using the sequential iteration construct.

The following example demonstrates a simple application: each step of
the iteration is a string representation of the byte count of the
previous step's output, with iteration terminating when the byte count
reaches zero.

Here's the program:

 
----
include::../../examples/iterate.swift[]
----

Where, echo is the standard unix echo utility.

_wcl_ is our application code - it counts the number of bytes in the one
file and writes that count out to another, like this:
 
----
$ cat ../wcl
#!/bin/bash
echo -n $(wc -c < $1) > $2

$ echo -n hello > a
$ wcl a b
$ cat b
5
----

Install the above wcl script somewhere and add a transformation catalog
(tc) entry for it (see an example below, note that you will need to change the path in third column to the path where wcl is located on your localhost).

----
localhost wcl /home/ketan/bin/wcl  INSTALLED  INTEL32::LINUX  null
----

Then run the example program like this:

 
----
$ swift iterate.swift
Swift svn swift-r3334 cog-r2752
