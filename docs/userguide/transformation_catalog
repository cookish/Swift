The Transformation Catalog - tc.data
------------------------------------
The transformation catalog lists where application executables are
located on remote sites.

By default, the site catalog is stored in etc/tc.data. This path can
be overridden with the tc.file configuration property, either in the
Swift configuration file or on the command line.

The format is one line per executable per site, with fields separated by
tabs. Spaces cannot be used to separate fields.

Some example entries:
----
localhost  echo    /bin/echo       INSTALLED       INTEL32::LINUX  null
TGUC       touch   /usr/bin/touch  INSTALLED       INTEL32::LINUX  GLOBUS::maxwalltime="0:1"
----

The fields are: site, transformation name, executable path, installation
status, platform, and profile entrys.

The site field should correspond to a site name listed in the sites catalog.

The transformation name should correspond to the transformation name
used in a SwiftScript app procedure.

The executable path should specify where the particular executable is
located on that site.

The installation status and platform fields are not used. Set them to
INSTALLED and INTEL32::LINUX respectively.

The profiles field should be set to null if no profile entries are to
be specified, or should contain the profile entries separated by
semicolons.
